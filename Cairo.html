   Cairo is a unique place because it is a soaring, kinetic megacity that bridges thousands of years of human history, earning its reputation as "Umm al-Dunya" (the Mother of the World). As the recently named 2026 Capital of Tourism for OIC Member States, it is a city of staggering contrasts where the Giza Pyramids and the world's largest collection of pharaonic treasures at the Grand Egyptian Museum stand just miles away from a high-energy urban core of nearly 23.5 million people. Beyond its ancient roots, Cairo is the historic heart of the Islamic world, often called the "City of a Thousand Minarets" for its medieval skyline of domes and towers that dates back to the 10th century. Today, this legacy is balanced by a modern pulse—from the contemporary galleries of the Art Cairo 2026 fair to the development of the New Administrative Capital, making it one of the few places on earth where you can navigate a 14th-century bazaar and a global financial center in the same afternoon.
